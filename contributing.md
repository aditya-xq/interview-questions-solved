If you have a new problem in mind that isn't listed, [open a new issue](https://github.com/aditya-xq/interview-questions-solved/issues) for discussion and tag it under the "question" label. Make sure to provide the exact question and the source of the same.
2. **Solution Structure**: Ensure your solution follows the structure outlined in the main README. This includes a detailed README for each solution, production-ready code, test cases, and a live demo link or instructions.
3. **Coding Style**: Maintain a consistent coding style. Include inline comments explaining your logic, especially in complex sections.
